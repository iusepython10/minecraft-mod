# ModernFix --- MINECRAFT MOD

**Installation**<br/>
First of all this mod works with python.What is needed to run the bot is winpython or linux

**Edit**<br/>
First download the project ```git clone https://github.com/iusepython10/minecraft-mod```
Install Python now if you want download it from the official website [download py](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or download it to your Linux system for debian systems ```sudo apt-get install python``` for manjaro familys ```sudo pacman -S python```.
Install libraries: ```pip install websocket_client opencv-python colorama requests```
And now run the bot ```python ModernFix.py```
It was a simple explanation and do not close the tab or put it in the background while the mod is open it cannot send pixels and if you try to send pixels from too many tabs and the same rope as the bots websocket will kick you out for a while.
